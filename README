Compile: make / make all
Run tests: make clean && make TEST=1
Run in qemu: make qemu / make qemu-nox
Debug with gdb: make qemu-gdb / make qemu-nox-gdb
                (in another terminal) gdb

Questions:
1. Processor starts executing 32-bit code at instruction address 0x7e79. 
   The instruction .code32 causes the switch from 16-bit to 32-bit code.
2. The last instruction executed by the boot loader is `jmp %edx` at 0x8f26.
   The first instruction of the kernel is `cli` at 0x1023f0`.
3. The first instruction of the kernel is at 0x1023f0.
4. Boot loader decides how many sectors it must read in order to fetch the entire 
   kernel from disk by using the program header table in the ELF file. 
   The ELF file is loaded from the first bootable position.
