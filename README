List here the following info:
1. who you have worked with: NA
2. whether you coded this assignment together, and if not, who worked on which part
3. brief description of what you have implemented
4. and anything else you would like us to know

Description of what I've implemented:
1. Thread and process management layer.
2. Trap handling.
3. Fork. In particularly, I implemented the mechanism of copy-on-write. When a process
   forks a child, its page table is copied into the child, but the page tables of the
   two processes are mapped to the same physical pages. The physical pages are then marked
   as "copy-on-write" (COW), and if either process tries to write to a shared page, it
   would then make a copy of that page before writing to it.
